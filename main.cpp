/* INSTRUCTIONS:
Refactor this code. The code currently is not modular at all; important code that could be reused is not contained in functions.

Rewrite the code such that it leverages functions to perform these linked list operations: adding a node to the front; adding a node to the tail;
deleting a node; inserting a node; and deleting the entire linked list.

Don't forget that the coding conventions for this course require using function prototypes. */
